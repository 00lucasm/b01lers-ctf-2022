Some notes on this problem:

0) only give them SHArdle.py, never the helper file!!! It is kept super-secret 
that we use a dictionary here. Part of their task is to realize that only 
English words are accepted.

1) the dictionary used is intentionally NOT stated, and should NOT be 
given out as hint either. It is a pretty big one => their job is 
to source a comprehensive English word list.

2) With a good ~1.5M word list, the chance of success is practically 100%.
Otherwise, you can easily build word lists from open-source English literature,
say 20M characters, 70k words, and have a roughly 1:10 chance that a word is in
your list => about 1:100 chance to solve the problem. It is thus anticipated that
most solvers will need to make multiple attempts until success.

3) The main reason there are 2 rounds is that people do not just keep guessing
the same one word until they get lucky.
